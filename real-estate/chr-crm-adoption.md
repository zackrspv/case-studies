# Case Study: Colorado Home Realty – CRM Adoption & IT Cost Reduction

## 🏢 Context
Colorado Home Realty (CHR) is a 200+ agent brokerage in Colorado’s real estate market.  
The firm struggled with technology adoption, scattered tools, and high operating costs — leaving leadership without visibility into performance and agents frustrated with disjointed workflows.

## 🚩 Problem
- **Low CRM adoption** – fewer than 50% of agents actively used the system.  
- **Scattered tools** – redundant platforms created complexity and frustration.  
- **High operating costs** – subscriptions and infra spend climbing with little ROI.  
- **Incomplete reporting** – leadership lacked a single source of truth.
