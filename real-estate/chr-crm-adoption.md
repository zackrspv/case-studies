# Case Study: Colorado Home Realty  
*Addressing technology adoption and cost challenges for a 200+ agent brokerage*  

---

## 🏢 Challenge Context
Colorado Home Realty (CHR) is a **200+ agent brokerage** serving the Colorado market.  
Despite investing in multiple tools, fewer than half of the agents consistently used the company’s core CRM.  

**Symptoms:**
- Incomplete data  
- Unreliable reporting  
- Agents juggling too many disconnected systems  
- Leadership lacking visibility into performance  
- Rising costs due to redundant platforms  

---

## 🚩 Key Issues Identified
- Low CRM adoption  
- Scattered tool presence  
- High operational costs  
- Incomplete reporting  

> **Insight:** Technology should make work easier, not harder.  
At CHR, the problem wasn’t too few tools — it was too many, poorly adopted and poorly aligned.

## 🔧 Approach
Using MarPhil LLC’s consulting framework, we broke the work into phases:

1. **Immediate Fixes** – Resolved the most pressing adoption blockers.  
2. **Audit** – Reviewed all tools, SOPs, and workflows to identify system flaws.  
3. **Mapping & Planning** – Designed a consolidation roadmap and implementation timeline.  
4. **Execution** – Implemented changes, documented SOPs, and trained agents.

## 📈 Results
- **CRM Adoption**: Increased from <50% → **90%+ daily usage**  
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced IT & operating costs by **42%**  
- **Reporting**: Delivered consistent, reliable executive dashboards  
- **Stability**: Consolidated tools and created a leaner, more secure multi-cloud environment

## 📊 Execution Highlights
- Consolidated overlapping platforms  
- Streamlined operations and collaboration  
- Improved data security across the stack  
- Documented SOPs to sustain adoption long-term

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Low adoption is rarely a “people problem” — it’s a **systems problem**.  
- Simplification and consolidation drive adoption more effectively than new tools.  
- Documented workflows + training turn technology from a liability into a strategic asset.
